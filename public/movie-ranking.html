<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. It has such a good perspective on how a man saves his
    life from rotting in a jail.</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>It teaches us the importance of standing up and protecting your loved ones.</p>
<h3>The Theory of Everything </h3>
<p>The movie depicts how devoted Dr. Stephen Hawking was to Physics despite his
    conditions.
